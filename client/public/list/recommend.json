            "content": "A top German politician has indicated that the EU might be open to looking again at post-Brexit trading relations with the UK, telling politicians to \u201ccall us\u201d. German finance minister Christian Lindner told BBC News that the UK has a \u201cstanding invitation\u201d on any future talks on reducing trade barriers or \u201cobstacles in daily business life\u201d. \u201cIf you want to intensify your trade relationship with the EU \u2013 call us!\u201d He told the broadcaster: \u201cIn the daily life of German corporates, there are new obstacles since Brexit\u2026 I don\u2019t think (the) United Kingdom is benefiting from Brexit. \u201cWe really appreciate the United Kingdom and its values, its people\u2026 and I would really, really appreciate it if we can intensify (the trading relationship) again,\u201d he said. The comments come after Rishi Sunak\u2019s deal with the EU on post-Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland, the Windsor Framework, appeared to usher in better relations between Brussels and London. The UK will also return to the European Union (EU)\u2019s \u00a385 billion Horizon research programme, in another sign of improved ties. Both Labour and the Conservatives remained committed to keeping the UK out of the EU\u2019s single market, but Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s party has been clear that it wants a better trade deal with the bloc. A Government spokesperson said: \u201cThe Trade and Co-operation Agreement is the world\u2019s largest zero-tariff, zero-quota free trade deal. \u201cIt secures the UK market access across key service sectors and opens new opportunities for UK businesses across the globe. \u201cFollowing the Windsor Framework, both the UK and EU have publicly committed to maximising the opportunities of the TCA even further.\u201d",

            "description": "EXCLUSIVE: Two cryptozoologists analysed the latest video purporting to show Bigfoot and pinpointed five giveaways as to what the mysterious hairy figure caught on camera really is",
            "content": "Earlier this week the community descended into a frenzy when footage emerged showing a mysterious walking up a mountain. The figure was spotted by Shannon Parker and her husband Stetson as they travelled on the Narrow Gauge train from Durango to Silverton in Colorado, , on October 8. Shannon was quick to snap photos, while a passenger next to them managed to capture a short video of the figure walking before it turned around, sat down and stared back at the train. Shannon shared the video and photos on and they quickly went viral. Shannon said she was convinced they had spotted a real Sasquatch, but experts aren't so sure and have pinpointed five things that suggest it was an elaborate hoax. Cryptozoologist and author Andy McGrath told The : \"The first issue is the perfect framing of the creature by the person holding the camera. This seems to indicate that they knew exactly where to point their camera, where the creature would be walking and even where the creature would stop and choose to sit. \"The second issue is the creature's route. It seems to be walking a predetermined route and even when it decides to sit, it almost directly looks toward the eyewitness holding the camera.\" Thomas Marcum, a filmmaker and founder of research group The Crypto Crew, reckons the footage is likely a person in a \"suit\". Two aspects of the creature's behaviour led him to that conclusion. He told the Daily Star: \"One thing that really stands out is the fact it didn't hear the train coming and waited until someone took about four seconds of video before it decided to sit down and hide. I guess it could be deaf but I doubt it. \"Also if you notice when it is walking the figure is looking down at the ground as if it were a person in a mask trying not to fall. I don't think a creature that is born and raised in the wilderness would need to look down so much as it walked. They would be used to the terrain and the movement would be natural. The movements seem very human to me.\" Both experts also highlighted the creature's physical appearance as a fifth sign, suggesting something dodgy may be afoot. McGrath said: \"From a distance, it appears to have loose-fitting fur with non-anatomical folds. In the close-up shots, it also appears to be wearing a crudely made mask.\" Marcum, referencing the close-up image of the creature, asked: \"Is it wearing glasses? Or is it the eye holes from a mask? What about the hair? Does it look natural to anyone?\"",

            "content": "San Francisco [California], October 14 (ANI): A long-term study conducted by UC Davis Health researchers gives fresh light on the association between autistic features and middle childhood mental health. According to the study, changes in core autistic traits are associated with whether children develop additional mental health difficulties over their primary school years. Also Read | Global Handwashing Day 2023 Date and Theme: Know the History and Significance of the International Event Aimed at Raising Awareness on the Importance of Hand Hygiene. The study was published in Autism. \"Our findings suggest that different aspects of a child's development may affect each other over time,\" explained Einat Waizbard-Bartov, a doctoral researcher in developmental psychology at the UC Davis MIND Institute and the lead author of the paper. \"Core autism traits and mental health challenges likely interact throughout development.\" Also Read | World Sight Day 2023: From Leafy Greens to Eggs, 10 Foods You Must Eat for Good Eyesight and Overall Eye Health. A key finding was that a reduction in restrictive and repetitive behaviours during elementary school was linked to the emergence of mental health challenges, lending support to the idea that these behaviours may benefit autistic individuals. An increase in social-communication difficulties during this time was also linked to anxiety and other mental health challenges. Waizbard-Bartov has published previous research showing autism characteristics can change significantly from ages 3 to 11. The current study included 75 autistic children ages 6 to 11, including 15 girls. All were part of the MIND Institute's Autism Phenome Project, a large, long-term study aimed at identifying different subtypes of autism. Through parental interviews and questionnaires, the research team evaluated the children for mental health symptoms and restricted and repetitive behaviours, which can include seeking sensory stimulation, hand-flapping or sticking to set routines. They tracked changes in autism characteristics using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule Calibrated Severity Score.r. About a third of the participants had both decreasing restricted and repetitive behaviours and increased social-communication difficulties. \"We were pleased to see that our results confirmed what has been suspected by other autism researchers and clinicians as well as autistic individuals, that some forms of restricted and repetitive behaviours can potentially help to self-soothe,\" said David Amaral, distinguished professor in the Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences, MIND Institute faculty member and senior author on the paper. Waizbard-Bartov notes that the findings question the wisdom of therapies that try to eliminate these behaviours. \"In light of this, when thinking about interventions, it might be that trying to eliminate repetitive behaviours without providing alternative self-soothing tools is not the ideal way to go,\" she said. The study is the first, to the authors' knowledge, to demonstrate an association between mental health challenges and increases in the severity of social-communication difficulties for autistic children. \"This occurred in children who showed decreases in core autism traits during early childhood and whose cognitive functioning was in the typical range. We don't currently understand why this happened. One possibility is that due to their relatively high cognitive ability, they became aware of their social challenges, and this may have contributed to increasing anxiety,\" Amaral explained. \"It's definitely an area where we need more research.\" (ANI) (This is an unedited and auto-generated story from Syndicated News feed, LatestLY Staff may not have modified or edited the content body)",

            "content": "Angelina Jolie looks unrecognizable in big glasses as she transforms into iconic opera singer Maria Callas in the first look at the biopic. Angelina turned away from her usual Hollywood glamor in the first pictures of Maria\u2019s biopic. The 48-year-old actress Angelina Jolie has transformed herself into the role of iconic opera singer Maria Callas for the film, which will follow her eventful legacy. In one shot of Angelina as Marie, the actress is makeup-free and wearing thick brown glasses and a chunky knit sweater as filming begins. In another photo, the glamorous diva looks much more glamorous with winged eyeliner, nude makeup, and a furry coat. Angelina is lucky enough to wear some of Callas\u2019 actually worn dresses in the film, including vintage fur items from Massimo Cantini Parrini\u2019s archival collection. Maria, who was one of the most acclaimed and influential opera singers of the 20th century, died in 1977. She was known for her incredible voice on stage, as well as her stormy love life, which included an affair with Greek shipping magnate Aristotle Onassis, who later married Jackie Kennedy. Jolie has played famous people before: In 1998, she starred as tragic supermodel Gia Carangi in Gia, and in 2007, she starred as Mariana Pearl in A Mighty Heart. Maria was written by Steven Knight before the WGA strike in Hollywood and provided an interim SAG-AFTRA contract. Callas lived from 1923 to 1977. She was born an American of Greek descent and then trained in Greece and Italy. She was not only known for her incredible voice, which made her one of the best opera singers of the 20th century, but also for her scarless beauty, which highlighted her numerous romances. She was also known for her fierce rivalry with Italian opera singer Renata Tebaldi. The film covers her life story and ends with her sad death in Paris after suffering from vision problems that left her almost blind. Acting in a Callas film was a passion for Faye Dunaway, who even wanted to use her own money for the film, but it never got off the ground. In 2014, Meryl Streep was supposed to play Callas in Master Class with Mike Nichols as her director, but the project did not materialize. Italian siren Monica Bellucci starred in a play about Callas last year. The film\u2019s release date has not yet been announced.",

            "content": "Despite signals that the fall in housing prices in The Netherlands has stalled, a new decline in home sales prices is possible, said Klaas Knot, the head of De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB), the Dutch central bank. \"I cannot rule out that prices will go up for a few months now, but will come down again later for a few months,\" he said in conversation with ANP. He also said that the period in which wages have been rising faster and faster seems to have come to an end. Last year and early this year, the average sales price of owner-occupied homes became considerably cheaper. This price drop was mainly due to rising mortgage interest rates, which reduces the amount of money many people can borrow to buy a home. But the latest figures on the housing market indicated that prices are actually picking back up again after months of decline. Owner-occupied homes are still cheaper than a year ago, but home buyers are paying more compared to earlier this year. The development of housing prices is currently not so easy to predict, Knot said. \"Seasonal patterns also play a role. It usually doesn't go in a straight line.\" The DNB boss also acknowledged that he had actually expected a larger price correction before prices started to rise. He no longer foresees \"no dramatic fall\" in housing prices. \"The Dutch have too much cash for that.\" Knot emphasized that unemployment is still \"super low,\" and, as a result, most people still have jobs, and therefore, money to spend. But Knot is anything but optimistic about the supply of housing on the market, because the Netherlands is struggling with an increasing housing shortage. He said it was difficult to have positive feelings about the state of the housing market. \"There are far too many Dutch people who are being left out.\" First-time buyers have great difficulty finding an affordable home. More homes really need to be built, because that is the only way to solve the housing shortage, he said. \"We are now seeing that residential investors are withdrawing. As a result, rental properties are being sold as owner-occupied properties. But that shift ultimately solves nothing, because more homes will not be added,\" he noted. \"It is at the expense of the free rental market. But that is very important for the flow. The free rental market is actually the lubricant for the housing market.\" There is still a bright spot. Knot is not concerned about the housing market purely with a view towards financial stability in the Netherlands. \u201cThe situation now is very different than in the aftermath of the financial crisis.\u201d This is because, according to previous research by DNB, even with a significant price correction, the mortgages of most households are unlikely to fall \"underwater.\" Knot also spoke about the recent period of dramatic increases in wages, saying that he sees the \"first signals of decreasing wage pressure.\" He called this \"encouraging\" news because it reduces the risk of a wage-price spiral, where wages drive increases in inflation. During his conversation with ANP, the central bank leader referred to recently published figures from employers' association AWVN. This showed that wages in concluded collective bargaining agreements increased less in September than in the new collective agreements from a month earlier. \"Wage growth appears to have peaked in June. In September the figures indicated a 'low 7' percent wage increase. That in itself is encouraging.\" Knot also based his conclusion on the new wage demands from the unions. Unlike last year, after the sharp rise in inflation due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the FNV labor union is no longer aiming for collective labor agreement wages that are 14 percent higher. The unions have now included ranges for the extra salary they want to demand in various sectors. Knot said he thinks that is a good thing in principle, because he believes that there are still sectors due a significant wage increase in collective labor agreements where there has been hardly any pay raise before. But for collective labor agreements where \"corrections\" have already made in terms of inflation, he believes it is better not to agree on a structural wage increase that is too high. \"I have always said that wage growth is welcome to restore purchasing power, but it should not hinder the desired return to price stability in the medium term.\" Earlier this year, the DNB boss repeatedly warned about the threat of a wage-price spiral. Such a scenario could occur if people had significantly more money to spend, and then they started spending more of it, and thus encouraged companies to further increase their prices. Initially, Knot was not concerned that the stronger wage increase would further drive up inflation, but he later pointed out that if the unions had their way with their wage demands at the time, a wage-price spiral was definitely on the horizon. Knot also visited FNV afterwards, he said. \"Of course, that does not mean that I now support the precise percentages of the union's wage demands. But despite the fact that we sometimes say some things about each other in the press, there is a constructive dialogue between FNV and DNB.\"",

            "content": "Synopsis The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict could potentially impact the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor (IMEEC) project, according to the Global Trade Research Initiative (GTRI). While the immediate consequences of the conflict are limited to Israel and Gaza, the ripple effects throughout the Middle East could have significant implications. AP The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict may lead to delays and complications in the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor project, according to think tank Global Trade Research Initiative ( GTRI ). It said while the conflict's immediate consequences are confined to Israel and Gaza, its ripple effects throughout the Middle East cannot be underestimated. GTRI said the conflict could derail the prospect of a historic peace deal between Israel and Saudi Arabia, a crucial linchpin in the India Middle East Europe Economic Corridor ( IMEEC ) framework. Although Saudi Arabia and Israel have historically maintained no formal diplomatic ties, recent years have witnessed signs of a thaw, with negotiations underway for normalisation, GTRI Co-Founder Ajay Srivastava said, adding that the war may derail any progress made. \"The ongoing Israel-Hamas conflict may disrupt the project's timelines and outcomes, marking a pivotal juncture in the development of this ambitious economic corridor. While the war's direct impact remains regional, the geopolitical consequences reverberate far beyond, with potential consequences for the proposed corridor,\" he added. IMEEC, a proposed economic corridor, aims to boost economic development by fostering connectivity and economic integration between Asia, the Persian Gulf, and Europe. The envisioned corridor would span from India to Europe, passing through the UAE, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Israel, and Greece. The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) for this was signed during the G20 summit in New Delhi last month, with participation from governments such as India, the US, the UAE, Saudi Arabia, France, Germany, Italy, and the European Union. The project's key goal is to enhance transportation and communication links between Europe and Asia, and it is often viewed as the response to China's Belt and Road Initiative. Srivastava added that the disruption in the Middle East, a vital link in this corridor, may lead to delays and complications in the project's execution.

Survey findings will support the UAOA campaign by providing an evidential base to lobby key stakeholders for action, advocacy, and investment.\u201d The FIA [on Friday] launches the inaugural barometer under the auspices of the United Against Online Abuse campaign \u2013 a strategic initiative designed to address the impact of online abuse against athletes, officials, volunteers, and others involved in the sport. The first edition survey, presented as a barometer, is designed to provide an assessment of the extent of online abuse against athletes, competitors, officials and participants aligned with over 70 international sporting bodies. The project team will be headed by Professor David Hassan, a leading researcher in sports management and policy, for over two decades. It will require respondents to evaluate the direct and indirect impact of online abuse, categorise the forms of abuse that they consider most prevalent and, importantly, invite sporting bodies to consider how a coherent response to the scourge of online abuse may be shaped and measured. It will also ask sporting bodies to gauge the consequences of online abuse in sports on women, young people, and minority groups. In total it will collate responses to over 35 key metrics tracking online abuse in sport, providing a unique insight into one of global sport\u2019s most insidious challenges. The FIA University Research team will lead the analysis and final presentation of the first Annual UAOA Barometer Survey, which will be conducted according to best research practices. Sporting federations should have completed the survey by the 30th of October with publication of the survey\u2019s findings due for release in December.
